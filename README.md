# Cognition

Cognition is an open-source platform for data ingest, data fusion and search. Cognition integrates Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Apache Storm, Apache Hadoop, Apache Accumulo and ElasticSearch to provide a robust solution capable of ingesting 10's of thousands of records per second. It can be deployed locally as a virtual machine or on private or public clouds. The goal of Cognition is to enable delivery teams employing big data technology to focus on client solutions instead of worrying about the plumbing of data ingest, storage and discovery.
